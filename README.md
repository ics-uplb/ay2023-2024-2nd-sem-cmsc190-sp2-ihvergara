# Evaluation of Image Pre-processing Techniques for Improved Rice Leaf Disease Detection
Authors: Ivyann Romijn H. Vergara and Mylah Rystie Anacleto

This study presents a digital platform for automated rice disease detection, addressing the inefficiencies of traditional visual inspections. We evaluated various image preprocessing techniques—specifically, histogram equalization in L and V channels and contrast stretching with factors of 0.5 and 2—to enhance disease classification accuracy. The original image achieved the highest classification accuracy at 94.34%, followed by contrast stretching at a factor of 2 (92.24%) and factor of 0.5 (91.61%). Histogram equalization methods yielded lower accuracies (88.68% for L channel and 82.60% for V channel). These results reveal a complex relationship between image quality metrics and classification performance, indicating that while high Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) suggest visual fidelity, they do not always correlate with improved disease detection. Future work will focus on integrating these findings into other Convolutional Neural Network models and developing a mobile app for real-time field detection.
